# CLI Data Browser
Warm up project for CS 205 Spring 2019 at the University of Vermont. We were taked with creating a system which allows users to query and view data through a command-line interface. Our project makes use of Python's Cmd library to create a custom interactive shell and uses SQLite for the database.
## Requirements
1. Collect and clean data into a relational database
	* Map to 2 Relational Database tables.
	* One table must have a foreign key to other table.
	* At least 30 records in each table.
	* At least 3 columns in each table.
2. Create the program to interact with the data
	* Build grammar for user to create "sentences" which translate into queries.
	* Allow user to type commands to query values from at least 3 columns of each table.
	* At least one query that involves a join between the two tables.
	* A command to let user view the schema.
## Data Set
Our data set contains the information about various TV shows and their networks, 
on/off air status, number of seasons, runtime, and genre.
